# WeatherMap

WeatherMap is a showcase app to display weather for user-selected cities using open weather map service. The code follows MVP architecture.
The application consists of a single activity (HomeActivity) & multiple fragments. 
- Fragments communicate using interface callbacks through the host activity so that fragments are unaware of each other.
- Fragments (View) send requests to presenters which communicate with suitable data respositories so that code is modular & adding/replacing/removing repository should be an easy job.
- Application's class "WeatherMapApp" has static methods to provided dependencies. 
- The code contain one sampple unit test
